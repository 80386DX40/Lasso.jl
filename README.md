# Lasso

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/simonster/Lasso.jl.png)](https://travis-ci.org/simonster/Lasso.jl)

Lasso.jl is a pure Julia implementation of the glmnet coordinate
descent algorithm for fitting linear and generalized linear Lasso and
Elastic Net models, as described in:

Friedman, J., Hastie, T., & Tibshirani, R. (2010). Regularization paths
for generalized linear models via coordinate descent. Journal of
Statistical Software, 33(1), 1. http://www.jstatsoft.org/v33/i01/

## Quick start

To fit a Lasso path with default parameters:

```julia
using Lasso
fit(LassoPath, X, y, dist, link)
```

`dist` is any distribution supported by GLM.jl and `link` defaults to
the canonical link for that distribution.

Parameters of the returned LassoPath object are documented in the
source [here](https://github.com/simonster/Lasso.jl/blob/3388dc338bfaa5a90280c90158b7e6a6e8b2b607/src/Lasso.jl#L314-L327).

## TODO

 - More documentation than just this README
 - Offsets don't work
 - User-specified weights and `Î± != 1` are untested
 - Maybe integrate LARS.jl
